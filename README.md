# Poppit
A social media like app for popping quick questions to your friends.
Sadly the app beckend service is no longer supported.
The app goal was to allow friends to reponds quickly to popped questions.
The interface allowed one to log in through his facebook account and than ask his facebook friends who are using the app simple questions.
The questions could be either yes/no, multiple-choise or even decisions base on visual hints (should I buy this shoes or these ones?)
Popped questions appeared on the screen as overlays in any time, and would make nice balloon pop sounds when answered.
